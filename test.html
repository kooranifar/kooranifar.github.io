    $ \text{I would like to mention the discussion in the comments that we had, because I think it might has gone a bit wrong: as we've said the assumption}  a_n \geq 1 \text{itself need not put a restriction on} f(x) \text{because of the} $g(x)$ argument that I made in the comments; but notice that for $g(x) = -a_nx^n-a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots-a_1x-a_0$ the sign of second largest coefficient also flips. So eventually, the restrictions on $f(x)$ really mean that $a_{n-1}$ is zero or it has the same sign as $ a_n $. About your questions I would provide some hints; but if it isn't sufficient, feel free to ask for elaboration.$

%1. note that $$ \sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{|a_i|}{|z|^{n-i}} \leq  \sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{H}{|z|^{n-i}} \tag{1} $$
%So by triangle inequality for left hand, and then multiplying sides by $-1$ we have
%$$ -|\sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{a_i}{z^{n-i}}| \geq  \sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{-H}{|z|^{n-i}} \tag{2} $$
%Now for the questioned inequality to hold, it suffices to show that $$ | f(z) / z^n | -  | a_n + \frac{a_{n-1}}{z} | \geq -|\sum_{i=2}^{n} \frac{a_i}{z^{n-i}}| \tag{3} $$ Hint for this: you may somewhere need to use: $  |a| - |b| \leq |a-b|  \tag{4}$
------
**More elaboration as requested:**

Let's show $(3)$ using triangle formula $(4)$,
\begin{align}
	& |\frac{f(z)}{z^n}| - |a_n + \frac{a_{n-1}}{z}| = | a_n + \frac{a_{n-1}}{z} + \frac{a_{n-2}}{z^2} + \cdots + \frac{a_0}{z^n}| - |a_n + \frac{a_{n-1}}{z}| \\
	\xrightarrow{(4)} &|\frac{a_{n-2}}{z^2} + \cdots + \frac{a_0}{z^n}|
\end{align}

2. Note that for every $z \in \mathbb{C}$ we have $ |z| \geq \mathfrak{R}(z) $. For the terms containing $ H $, as a hint, multiply sides by $ |z|^n $ and take a look at what happens. The fact that $ |z| > 1 $ shows why the whole inequality is a $ > $ and not a $ \geq $.

3. As you correctly said, the assumptions on coefficients are needed in this inequality. More specifically, for showing that 
$$ \mathfrak{R}\left(a_n+\frac{a_{n-1}}{z}\right) \ge 1 $$
in the following way: Since $ \mathfrak{R}(z) > 0 $ and real parts of $z$ and $\frac{1}{z}$ have the same sign, we also have $\mathfrak{R} ( \frac{1}{z} ) > 0$ and by that, 
$$ \mathfrak{R}\left(a_n+\frac{a_{n-1}}{z}\right) = a_n + a_{n-1} \mathfrak{R}(\frac{1}{z}) \geq 1 + 0 = 1 $$ 
following our discussion in the comments, assuming that $ a_n \geq 1 $, if $ a_{n-1} $ was negative, I don't see an easy way to deduce this last inequality; But maybe others could.
