					Hello! The discussion here is a rethinking of me about another discussion with friends, which was about formalizing some other statement in propositional logic.
	For now, the statement is this,
	$$ \text{I can go running.} $$
	And we are asked to formalize this statement in propositional logic language. It was proposed that this statement itself can be considered as a proposition. But I have got into troubles in accepting that. There are two reasons for my resistance.

	First, I thought of propositions as statements whose truth-value <itcmu>can</itcmu> be determined. Now I think one should be cautious about the meaning of the word \emph{can}.
		A first objection that I made was caused by the fact (a belief of mine) that being able to assign a truth-value to a statement is a key feature for it to be able to consider it as a proposition. Now unlike some more common examples of propositions, you cannot determine the truth value of this statement. For example, fixing a moment in time (in order to stay out of the realm of temporal logic), the truth-value of the statement "It's 9 o'clock" can always easily be determined, it's just enough that you check your phone's clock; But in the case of the statement "I can go running", it is not clear that the truth can be that easily evaluated: maybe there are infinitely many considerations one has to make in order to be able to tell if the statement is true (physically speaking, there infinite possibilities for the temprature of the day, humidity percentage and so on. If someone does not agree that humidity percentage has infinitely many possibilities since it's the proportion of water molecules (a finite quantity) to molecules of air (another finite quantity) so there are finite possibilities, then another way to convice someone that there are infinitely many possibilities is that for each particle in the universe, there is an orientation in 3D space, a speed vector and an acceleration vector, for each of which there are infinite possibilites, and therefore the world has infinitely many states to be considered). Now to say that this statement is a proposition, I think it is to claim that at every state of the universe if we evaluate the statement, we can assign a truth-value to it. 
		\textbf{albate be nazar chert goftam/nagereft in tikke ye infinitely many possibilities, choon in infinite possibility haa, possibility haaye world hastan, ke maa ba in kaari nadarim, ma baraamoon mohemme ke age ye possibility of world behemoon bedan betoonim tooye oon barresi konim bebinim can I run yaa na. ke fekr konam dige age ye momment az universe ro daashte baashim moshaxxas baashe vaqean. behtare pas vaqean ye chiz e dige mesaal bezanam ke beshe bekeshe be infinitely many maajara. fekring... "if you start generating random ones and zeros, after some times and at one point you get a zero." (ayaa vaqean randomness haqiqat daare? ayaa mishod mesaali bezanam ke az padide ye random toosh estefaade nemishd? shayad hich raah e dige i vojood nadaashte baashe va faqat randomness baashe. oonvaqt age randomness vojood nadaashte baashe, yani hamechi truth-value sh feasible hast. albate ye bahs e dige mimoone ke maa gozaare haayi daarim ke na dorost na qalat hastan mesl e paradox e russell, oonaa ro chikaar konim? yejoori az bahs dooreshoon konim.)} Now in this last example we really are having 
		In this sense, here is a matter of feasibility of the truth-value. For "It's 9 o'clock" the truth-value can be  reached within finite steps.
		
		
		$$ \text{raw idea: not feasible truth-value = logic. feasible = computability theory.}$$
		$$ \text{easily feasible = complexity theory}$$
	
	The second objection I was making was that the sentence is I think the statement is equivalent to the following statement:
	$$ \forall \ \text{requisiteOfRunning} \quad \text{doesHold(requisiteOfRunning) }$$
	I mean that for a person to be able to go running, it is equivalent that every requisite of running is meeted (if all of requisites is meeted then cleary one can go running, and if one requisite does not meet then you cannot go running). By this form, the proposition does actually contain a quantifier, which was not allowed in propositional logic. But it's a bit strange, since we can meaningfuly (some senseless quantifierizing is to take some $p(x)$, then $p(a)$ is a propositional statement, and restate it as $\forall x \ (x = a \to p(x))$. now is this propositional or first-order logic?) model one statement both with quantifier and without quantifier. So a question is how to exactly distinguish between a propositional logic statement and a first-order logic statement. Again I think this could be asked from 2 different viewpoint,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Syntactic:} Given a formula like $\forall x \ (x = a \to p(x))$, how can we find out that the formula is quantifier-clearable? This seems like an algorithmic or combinatoric question.
		\item \textbf{Semantic:} Given an english sentence, how can be determined if the statement is in the realm of propositional logic or in the realm of first-order logic?\\
		This is the question I was more thinking about (excites me more). 
	\end{enumerate}
